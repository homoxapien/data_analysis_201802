# data_analysis_201802

Based on an interesting article written by Mesfin Gebeyaw about web scrapping and cluster analysis.

Updated to the most recent data (2017) and add in some cluster tendency analysis to see new results.
Due to new version of R, for spatial information, I switched to the wonderful package of ggmap, created by D. Kahle and H. Wickham.
